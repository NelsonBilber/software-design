* S.O.L.I.D
** Class Design (5)
**** SRP - The Single Responsibility Principle
The class should have one, and only one, reason to change
**** OCP - The Open Closed Principle
You should be able to extend a class behaviour, without modifying it
**** LSP - The Liskov Substitution
Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes
**** ISP - The Interface Segregation Principle
Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific
**** DIP - The Dependency Inversion Principle
Depend on abstractions, not on concretions
** Pack Cohesion (3)
**** REP- The Release Reuse Equivalency
The granule of reuse is the granule of release
**** CCP - The Common Closure Principle
Classes that change together are packed together
**** CRP - The Common Reuse Principle
Classes that are used together are packed together
** Couple Between Packaged (3)
**** ADP - The Acyclic Dependencies Principle
The dependency graph of packages must have no cycles
**** SDP - The Stable Dependencies Principle 
Depend in direction of stability
**** SAP - The Stable Abstractions Principle
Abstractness increases with stability
